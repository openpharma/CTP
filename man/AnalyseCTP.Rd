\usage{
AnalyseCTP(ctp.struc, model, data, factor.name = NULL, test.name = "F", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments for the chosen test.}

\item{\code{ctp.struc}}{Object generated by the function \code{\link{IntersectHypotheses}} (structure of CTP)}

\item{\code{model}}{model of the form response~treatment. If \code{testname="F"}, the model can be extended by covariates and other factors.
In the case
of a Logrank test the response must be imputed as \code{Surv(time,status)}.}

\item{\code{data}}{Dataframe, missing values in the response or treatment variable are not allowed!}

\item{\code{factor.name}}{Character string naming the factor whose levels are compared (treatment factor).
By default the first variable of the right-hand side of the model formula is used.}

\item{\code{test.name}}{One of the following strings \itemize{
    \item \code{"F"} - F-Test (ANOVA, default)
    \item \code{"kruskal"} -Kruskal-Wallis-Test
    \item \code{"chisq"} - Chi square test
    \item \code{"prob"} - Fisher's exact test for total number of observations <200 else Chi square test
    \item \code{"lgrank"} - Logrank-test
    \item \code{"jonckheere"} - Jonckheere-Terpstra test of ordered alternatives
}}
}
\value{
An object of old class(\code{ctp}), consisting of a list with:
  \itemize{
   \item{CTPparms} List with objects describing the CTP setup.
   \item{pvalues} Dataframe with all tested hypotheses, raw and adjusted p-values.
  }
}
\description{
Calculation of p-values of a closed testing procedure (CTP).
The function returns an object of \code{oldClass "ctp"; summary()} and \code{Display()} can be applied.
}
\details{
The hypothesis tree of the closed testing procedure must be created using \code{\link{IntersectHypotheses}}. For more details on the theory and the implementation as well
	for many examples, see the vignettes.
}
\note{
This procedure is constructed for testing differences and two-sided hypotheses,
	but not for equivalence tests. It is further based on independent samples from the population involved
	(i.e. on parallel group designs, but not on cross-over designs).
